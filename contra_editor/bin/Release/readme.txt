/====================================\
|Contra Editor 0.33a by Kurtis (2013)|
\====================================/

Information
===========
This editor is made for Contra, Probotector for the NES.
This won't work with the Japanese version!
You can almost edit all levels, except level 2 and 4 and
only the level elements.
Enemies will appear at their default position.

Alpha version
=============
It is really unstable, so watch where do you click or press
or the level can get messed up, that is why I made 2 buttons:
Save BAK and Res BAK

Installation
============
- Extract the archive somewhere
- Copy your Contra, Probotector NES file to the editor's
  folder (where contra_editor.exe is)
- Name your nes file to contra.nes
- Start contra_editor.exe

Other:
- If you want to change the NES file, delete data\contra.nes.dat

Editing
=======
Info:
If you press Res BAK, you can load my edited level, but only
if you didn't made any Save BAK before.

After editing some details I hope you will figure out why
do some pictures have white squares on the top left corner,
because it is really important when editing.

1. Load the program
2. Click on Load (if you want change the scene to another)
3. Click only on a white square, or else graphics can mess up
4. Change the ID, only change the length if you know what you're doing
5. Press the Write Data button and after I recommend press
   the Save BAK button (if you don't see any problems)
6. Close the program if you finished editing
7. Load Contra.nes, enjoy
