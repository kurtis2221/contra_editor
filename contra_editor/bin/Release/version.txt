  (only 1 unknown object will appear at the upper left corner)

Alpha 0.2

  messes up for unknown reasons
- Level 6 can be edited, but without the boss screens (last 1 or 2)

Alpha 0.1.2
===========
- Rewritten 1/4 of the code, scene removed, added scrollbar
- Level load time increased, but precise saving
- Fixed length (recommended modifying: length > 0), works MOST of times
- Note:
  screen bytes = (length > 0) + (length = 0) if more or less screens can mess up
  but I'm not sure about this is true about the level generation
  If you can understand this I think you won't have any problems with the length.
- Added map glitch scanner, it can take a little time to inform you
  (info from current screen, not whole map, NOT TESTED FULLY!)
- With length might mess up 2nd level data
- Map reading is 99% precise
