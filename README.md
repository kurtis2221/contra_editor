# Contra and SuperC level editor - NES

## Info
I wrote these editors because I wanted to edit Contra levels, but there was no editor for it.

It is a very basic editor, it has its flaws. The older versions suffered performance issues.

Currently the enemy editing is for Contra only, but it's unfinished and not user friendly.

## Projects

### contra_editor
Editor for Contra NES

It works with Contra and Probotector. Doesn't work with the Famicom version

Level 2 and 4 is not editable

### supercontra_editor
Editor for SuperC NES

SuperC editor works with SuperC and Probotector 2 and should work with the Famicom version

Level 2 and 6 is not editable

It doesn't have an enemy editor

## Usage
1. Copy your Contra.nes file to the program's folder
2. Load the program
3. Click on the Load button
4. Click on a white square that you want to edit
5. Change the ID, only change the length if you know what you're doing
6. Press the Write Data button and after I recommend press the Save BAK button
   (if you don't see any problems)
7. Close the program if you finished editing
8. Load Contra.nes, enjoy
